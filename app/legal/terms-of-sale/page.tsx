          This Agreement is between Sacred Kaleidoscope Community, doing business as LifeCharter Command Suite
          (&ldquo;Company,&rdquo; &ldquo;we,&rdquo; &ldquo;our,&rdquo; &ldquo;us&rdquo;) and the individual or

        <h2 className={H2}>3. Fees and Payment</h2>
        <p className={P}>
          3.1 Implementation Fee. Client pays the one-time Implementation Fee for the selected tier at the time of
          purchase. The Implementation Fee covers onboarding, initial setup of Client&apos;s workspace, and the start
          of the implementation period.
        </p>
        <p className={P}>
          3.2 Monthly Fee. Client&apos;s Monthly Fee begins approximately 30 days after the Implementation Fee is
          charged, once implementation is complete, and recurs monthly thereafter for the duration of this
          Agreement.
        </p>
        <p className={P}>
          3.3 Payment Method. Client authorizes Company to charge the payment method on file for the Implementation
          Fee and all recurring Monthly Fees until this Agreement ends in accordance with Section 4.
        </p>
        <p className={P}>
          3.4 Price Changes. Company may change Monthly Fees for future billing periods with at least 30 days&apos;
          notice. Price changes will not apply retroactively to fees already charged.
        </p>

        <h2 className={H2}>4. Year-1 Commitment</h2>
        <p className={P}>
          4.1 Term. By purchasing a tier, Client commits to twelve (12) consecutive months of Monthly Fee billing
          (the &ldquo;Year-1 Term&rdquo;), beginning on the date Client&apos;s first Monthly Fee is charged.
        </p>
        <p className={P}>
          4.2 Early Cancellation. If Client cancels before completing the Year-1 Term, Client will pay an early
          termination fee equal to the greater of (a) $500, or (b) fifty percent (50%) of the remaining Monthly Fees
          owed for the balance of the Year-1 Term, due immediately upon cancellation.
        </p>
        <p className={P}>
          4.3 After Year 1. Once the Year-1 Term is complete, this Agreement continues on a month-to-month basis
          until terminated in writing by either Client or Company, with at least forty-five (45) days&apos; advance
          notice (email to amilynne@amilynnecarroll.com is sufficient from Client&apos;s side).
        </p>

        <h2 className={H2}>5. Refund Policy</h2>

        </p>
        <p className={P}>
          5.2 Monthly Fees. Monthly Fees already charged are non-refundable. Client may cancel future Monthly Fee
          billing in accordance with Section 4.
